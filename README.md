<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![](images\mockup11.PNG)](https://example.com)

I propose the development of a cross-platform medical care application for mobile 
devices and computers that aims to connect patients and healthcare 
providers seamlessly. The application used by patients in their mobile 
devices specifically smart phones will allow patients to schedule their 
appointments, access their medical records, receive telemedicine 
consultations, and interact with healthcare professionals who will be 
using the computer applications in their respective workplaces on a 
daily basis. Leveraging the power of Firebase, the applications will 
ensure real-time data synchronization between Android devices and 
desktop computers, ensuring a smooth and efficient healthcare experience.

Here's why:
* Tanzania is dealing with serious health issues, such as taking care of people's health because it does not have enough resources and its healthcare system is not very strong. 
* Many moms and kids get sick and even die from illnesses like HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria. Not many people have access to doctors and nurses. 
* The government is trying to make healthcare better by spending money on things like medicine and hospitals. But a big part of the money comes from other countries helping. 
* Not many people in Tanzania have health insurance, which helps pay for medical costs. The government wants to improve things like vaccines for kids and the quality of healthcare. 
* They also want companies to make medicine in Tanzania. However, local companies might face problems like not having enough skilled workers or good technology. ([Tanzania - Healthcare](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/tanzania-healthcare))

Here's solution:
* I propose the creation of a cross-platform medical care app for mobile devices and computers, addressing healthcare challenges through technology. Computer technology (CT) solutions can significantly improve healthcare accessibility, especially in resource-limited rural areas. 
* The app will enable patients to easily schedule appointments, access medical records, and receive telemedicine consultations via smartphones, while healthcare providers will use computer applications for their tasks. 
* By utilizing Firebase, real-time data synchronization between Android devices and desktop computers will be ensured, enhancing healthcare experiences for both patients and professionals. 
* This solution aligns with the aim of my project to bridge healthcare gaps and enhance medical services for individuals and communities by harnessing the potential of CT solutions. ([Tanzania ICT in Healthcare](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/tanzania-ict-healthcare))

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The project after unzipping the files you can open your android studio and
on the file section at the top of your navigation bar, you can choose open file option and select the 
unzipped folder which you trust and open a new window for the project and continue
to work with the project after that.

### Prerequisites

For testing you require an emulator for testing the working of the project. After 
installation of the emulator then you can continue to run the project on the emulator.


### Installation

_To install and run the Cross-Platform MedicalCare Application in Android Studio project from GitHub on your local machine, follow these steps:_

1. Install Android Studio:
* If you haven't already, download and install Android Studio on your computer.

2. Install Git:
* If Git is not already installed on your machine, download and install it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

3. Clone the GitHub Repository:
* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```sh
   cd ~/Documents/AndroidProjects
   ```
* Clone the GitHub repository using the following command (replace repo-url with the actual URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone):

   ```sh
   git clone repo-url
   ```
    This will create a local copy of the project on your machine.

4. Open the Project in Android Studio:
* Launch Android Studio.
* Click on "Open an Existing Project" or "File" -> "Open..." in the Android Studio welcome screen.
* Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, select the project's root folder (usually contains the `build.gradle` files), and click "OK" to open the project.

5. Sync Gradle and Build the Project:
* Android Studio may prompt you to sync Gradle files. Click on the "Sync Now" link in the notification bar or go to "File" -> "Sync Project with Gradle Files" to ensure all project dependencies are resolved.
* Once the Gradle sync is complete, you can build the project by clicking the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)."

6. Run the Project:
* After a successful build, you can run the Android app on an emulator or a physical Android device. Make sure you have an emulator set up or connect a device via USB.
* Click the "Run" button (usually a green play button) in Android Studio's toolbar or go to "Run" -> "Run 'app'" to start the app.

7. Customize and Develop:
* You now have the project running on your local machine. You can make changes to the code, add features, and customize it to your needs.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The cross-platform healthcare application aims to revolutionize the patient-provider interaction, providing a seamless experience across Android devices and desktop computers. By leveraging the capabilities of Firebase, the application will offer real-time data synchronization, authentication, and secure communication, enhancing healthcare services for patients and providers alike. With a dedicated team and a comprehensive approach, it will be possible, I am confident in delivering a successful and impactful healthcare solution.
